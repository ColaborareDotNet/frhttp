FRHTTP is a backend web framework designed to facilitate the development of functional reactive web services/sites.

Key benefits:
* eliminates callback hell
* easy to reason about
* easier to test (since functions can be tested in isolation)
* facilitates code reuse (potentially even with your frontend)
